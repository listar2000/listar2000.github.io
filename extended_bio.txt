Misc I: before Study Abroad: Sida Li (李思达) spent his high school years (2015-2018) at the Affiliated High School of South China Normal University (Huafu International) and studied widely about economics and history subjects.

Misc II: I've been kept from visiting my family in China due to the COVID policy between 2020 and 2022. I would remember this for the rest of my life.
