I'm very willing to talk with you and answer questions over grad school application stuffs, especially M.S./Ph.D. applications in the field of statistics and data science. Potential topics include: (1) **Positioning**: what programs might be of your interest and there's high probability for you to get in. (2) **Techniques**: basically methodologies on how to get good rec letters & engage in research efficiently.

Having said that, statistics is such a broad field that I cannot, and don't want to, comment on areas that I've had little knowledge about. Please don't use these meetings for specific research questions or asking about my opinion on a certain academic matter.


<h1 style="font-size: 30px" id="reading">2. Reading Program in Variational Inference</h1>

üìö: Exact reading list [here](vi_reading_list); also refer to [this repo](https://github.com/listar2000/personal_website_dev)

I'm super grateful for the many reading programs that I have done over the past years, and would love to offer the same opportunity for current students @ UChicago. In particular, variational inference has grown out of an approximate Bayesian method and become a pivotal tool in generative AI and representation learning. Starting from **June 2024**, I plan to host 1-2 students in a reading group for recent VI advancements. The ultimate goal of the program would be original research topics in the field, with potential opportunity to collaborate on a conference paper. Feel free to email me with **[VI reading]** title for any related inquires.
