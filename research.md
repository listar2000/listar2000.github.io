## Lead Poisoning
In collaboration with the Chicago Department of Public Health, I led the development of a predictive model to target home lead investigations. The source code is available on [GitHub](htts://github.com/chicago/lead-model). Our work was reported in the [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-big-data-police-misconduct-met-20160816-story.html), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/predictive-policing-food-poisoning/423126/), and [South Side Weekly](http://southsideweekly.com/living-with-lead/). We wrote a paper on the development of the model and are working on its validation:

## Hazardous Waste
I led a collaboration with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to predict violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which governs the management of hazardous waste. The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dssg/rcra) and we are working on a paper:
