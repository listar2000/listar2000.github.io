## Lead Poisoning
In collaboration with the Chicago Department of Public Health, I led the development of a predictive model to target home lead investigations. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chicago/lead-model). Our work was reported in the [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-big-data-police-misconduct-met-20160816-story.html), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/predictive-policing-food-poisoning/423126/), and [South Side Weekly](http://southsideweekly.com/living-with-lead/). We wrote a paper on the development of the model and are working on its validation:

As a member of the Proactively Addressing Substandard Housing (PASH) working group, I helped draft a city ordinance proposing the [Chicago Healthy Homes Inspection Program (CHHIP)](https://www.tenants-rights.org/programs/advocacy/chhip/), a universal rental housing inspection program to protect tenants from health hazards including lead.
