I am an first-year Ph.D. student at UChicago [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) (DSI) working with [Prof. Nikolaos Ignatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/). Previously, I finished my M.S. in Statistics under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/). I am also a part of the [AER Lab](https://musslick.github.io/AER_website/About.html) at Brown under the mentorship of [Prof. Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/). Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XBTlUzUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research interests seek to answer two questions: (1) how to leverage probablistic thinking, e.g. prior knowledge and decision theory, to build more robust and versatile machine learning models (**Probablistic ML**)? (2) how do we allow efficient and accurate inferences on model predictions when faced with large-scale real world data (**Prediction-Powered Inference**)?

Even earlier, I graduated from UC Berkeley with double majors in Stat & CS. 

<!-- For **current/prospective students** having questions about M.S./Ph.D. applications in Statistics/DS, I plan to spend an hour every week doing online Q&A. Feel free to book my time [here](projects/external_opportunities); for current <u>UChicago undergrad/master</u> interested in my variational inference reading list, you can contact me for potential [reading program](projects/external_opportunities#reading). -->
