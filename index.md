I'm a research scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment](https://sustainability.illinois.edu/).

I'm interested in environmental monitoring, public health, and public policy. My recent [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research.html) is primarily in soil carbon, water quality, and childhood lead poisoning. My methodological interests include Bayesian multilevel and spatiotemporal modeling, causal inference, targeted interventions, and experimental design.

I was previously at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu) and [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu). Before that, I studied mathematics at Northwestern where my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
