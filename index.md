I'm a researcher at the Universty of Chicago's Center for Data Science and Public Policy.

I currently work in the domains of public health (childhood lead poisoning) and the environment (hazardous waste).

My research interests include targeted interventions, causal inference (program evaluation), field trial design, sample selection bias, and spatiotemporal modeling.

I previously studied mathematics and my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
