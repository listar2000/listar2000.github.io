I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu).

My current [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects.html) are in the domains of public health and the environment.
My methodological interests include targeted interventions, program evaluation, field trial design, sample selection bias, and spatiotemporal modeling.

I was previously at the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu). Before that, I studied mathematics at Northwestern and my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
