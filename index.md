I am an incoming Ph.D. student at UChicago [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) (DSI), and a second-year M.S. Statistics student advised by [Prof. Daniel Sanz-Alonso](https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/sanz-alonso/). I am also a part of the [AER Lab](https://musslick.github.io/AER_website/About.html) at Brown under the mentorship of [Prof. Sebastian Musslick](https://smusslick.com/).

My research interests seek to answer two questions: (1) how to leverage probablistic thinking, e.g. prior knowledge and decision theory, to build more robust and versatile machine learning models (**Probablistic ML**)? (2) how do we allow efficient inferences on these models when faced with large-scale real world data (**Approximate Inference**)?

Concrete projects I've worked or is working on include deep probablistic models for *symbolic regression*, accelerating *Langevin Monte Carlo* inference engine, and various *scentific software package* developments. See my [research page](projects/uchicago_thesis) for details.

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with double majors in Stat & CS. My academic journey started with working alongside [Prof. Allen Yang](https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/people/allen-y-yang/) and [Prof. Aditya Guntuboyina](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aditya/). A boring but extended bio about my life before college is at [here](extended_bio.txt).
