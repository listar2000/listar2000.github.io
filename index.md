I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu).

I'm broadly interested in public policy and public health. My recent [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects.html) are primarily in environmental health with a focus on childhood lead poisoning. My methodological interests include targeted interventions, program evaluation, experimental design, and spatiotemporal modeling.

I was previously at the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu). Before that, I studied mathematics at Northwestern and my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
