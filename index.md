I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu).

I'm interested broadly in public policy and public health. My recent [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research.html) is primarily in environmental health with a focus on childhood lead poisoning. My methodological interests include causal inference, Bayesian multilevel modeling, targeted interventions, experimental design, and spatiotemporal modeling.

I was previously at the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu). Before that, I studied mathematics at Northwestern and my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
