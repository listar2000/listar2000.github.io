I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Chicago's [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu).

My current [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects.html) is in the domains of public health and the environment.
My methodological interests include targeted interventions, program evaluation, field trial design, sample selection bias, and spatiotemporal modeling.

I previously studied mathematics and my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis.
