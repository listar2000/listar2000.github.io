## Teaching

I taught [Introduction to Programming for Public Policy](https://harris-ippp.github.io/) for Harris masters students in Spring 2018. I will teach Program Evaluation for Harris undergraduates in Spring 2019.

## Writing
My article [Why It's So Hard To Find Out Where the Candidates Stand](http://washingtonmonthly.com/2016/11/04/why-its-so-hard-to-find-out-where-the-candidates-stand/) about the history and future of election information was published in the Washington Monthly.

## Software
[{% newthought 'Is the Weather Weird?' %}](https://www.istheweatherweird.com) Jonah-Bloch Johnson and I made a website to help answer that question.

[{% newthought 'Higher Ground' %}](https://github.com/potash/higher-ground) This work-in-progress uses OpenStreetMap data to analyze and visualize urban greenspace. I used it to write an [article](articles/17/chicago-parks) about Chicago greenspace which was reported by [CBS](http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/11/06/park-566-master-plan/).

[{% newthought 'drain' %}](https://github.com/potash/drain) is a simple and powerful Python framework for reproducible and parallel data science workflows.

[{% newthought 'collate' %}](https://github.com/dssg/collate) is a Python library for generating spatiotemporal aggregation SQL queries, primarily for building features for machine learning and other models.

[{% newthought 'acs2pgsql' %}](https://github.com/dssg/acs2pgsql) is a [drake](https://github.com/factual/drake) workflow for bulk importing the American Community Survey (ACS) data and TIGER shapefiles from the U.S. Census FTP into a PostgreSQL database.
