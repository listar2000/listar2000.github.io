## Teaching

In Winter 2020 I am teaching Introduction to Program Evaluation (PBPL 26433) and Multilevel Regression Modeling for Public Policy (PPHA 41420). I previously taught Introduction to Program Evaluation in Spring 2019 and [Introduction to Programming for Public Policy](https://harris-ippp.github.io/) in Spring 2018.
